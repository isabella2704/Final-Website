<h3>Human Rights Should Apply to People of <em> All </em> Ages </h3>
<p>Elder abuse, child abuse, and overall direspect to people of different ages all ties into discrimination.
 You have probably felt it in at least one day of your life. 
 When you have been treated unfairly because you are too young or old, that is ageism. 
 We should not let people continue this any longer. </p>
 <p>It is one of the most socially condoned and institutionalized forms of prejudice in the United States.It is been an issue since the beginning of time, but only 50 years ago was the term invented.</p> <center> <p> HUMAN RIGHTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BY AGE</p>
<p> Ageism is a worlwide issue and in China especially it is a huge problem. Lots of people lose their jobs ad career due to ageism, and are forced to be placed into retirement and homes for elderly people, even when they are not ready. No one should be treated unfair, and if anything we should treat our elders with respect because of all they have done for us.</p>
<p>Get educated, speak up, and let your voice be heard today. </p>
